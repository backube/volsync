### Changed

- :warning: Breaking change :warning: - Helm chart now manages VolSync CRDs
  directly.  
  Upgrading the VolSync Helm chart from an earlier version will produce the
  following error:

  ```
  Error: UPGRADE FAILED: rendered manifests contain a resource that already exists. Unable to continue with update: CustomResourceDefinition "replicationdestinations.volsync.backube" in namespace "" exists and cannot be imported into the current release: invalid ownership metadata; label validation error: missing key "app.kubernetes.io/managed-by": must be set to "Helm"; annotation validation error: missing key "meta.helm.sh/release-name": must be set to "volsync"; annotation validation error: missing key "meta.helm.sh/release-namespace": must be set to "volsync-system"
  ```

  To fix, apply the missing labels and annotations as mentioned in the error
  message (your values may differ), then retry the upgrade:

  ```console
  $ kubectl label crd/replicationdestinations.volsync.backube app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm
  customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/replicationdestinations.volsync.backube labeled
  $ kubectl label crd/replicationsources.volsync.backube app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm

  $ kubectl annotate crd/replicationdestinations.volsync.backube meta.helm.sh/release-name=volsync

  ReplicationDestination `.status.conditions[]` in favor of returning errors via

- Move Rclone and Rsync movers to the Mover interface
- Switch snapshot API version from `snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1beta1` to
  `snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1` so that VolSync remains compatible w/ Kubernetes
  1.24+
- Minimum Kubernetes version is now 1.20 due to the switch to
  `snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1`
