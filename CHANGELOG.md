## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Users can manually label destination Snapshot objects with
  `volsync.backube/do-not-delete` to prevent VolSync from deleting them. This
  provides a way for users to avoid having a Snapshot deleted while they are
  trying to use it. Users are then responsible for deleting the Snapshot.
- Publish Kubernetes Events to help troubleshooting

### Changed

- Operator-SDK upgraded to 1.22.0
- Rclone upgraded to 1.58.1
- Restic upgraded to 0.13.1
- Syncthing upgraded to 1.20.1

### Fixed

- CLI: Fixed bug where previously specified options couldn't be removed from
  relationship file
- Fixed issue where a snapshot or clone created from a source PVC could
  request an incorrect size if the PVC capacity did not match the
  requested size.

### Removed

- "Reconciled" condition removed from ReplicationSource and
  ReplicationDestination `.status.conditions[]` in favor of returning errors via
  the "Synchronizing" Condition.

- Move Rclone and Rsync movers to the Mover interface
- Switch snapshot API version from `snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1beta1` to
  `snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1` so that VolSync remains compatible w/ Kubernetes
  1.24+
- Minimum Kubernetes version is now 1.20 due to the switch to
  `snapshot.storage.k8s.io/v1`

### Fixed
