   .. contents:: Backing up using Restic



VolSync supports taking backups of PersistentVolume data using the Restic-based
data mover. A ReplicationSource defines the backup policy (target, frequency,
and retention), while a ReplicationDestination is used for restores.

The Restic mover is different than most of VolSync's other movers because it is
not meant for synchronizing data between clusters. This mover is specifically
meant for data backup.

Specifying a repository
=======================

For both backup and restore operations, it is necessary to specify a backup
repository for Restic. The repository and connection information are defined in
a ``restic-config`` Secret.

Below is an example showing how to use a repository stored on Minio.

.. code-block:: yaml

   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: restic-config
   type: Opaque
   stringData:
     # The repository url
     RESTIC_REPOSITORY: s3:http://minio.minio.svc.cluster.local:9000/restic-repo
     # The repository encryption key
     RESTIC_PASSWORD: my-secure-restic-password
     # ENV vars specific to the chosen back end
     # https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/030_preparing_a_new_repo.html
     AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: access
     AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: password

This Secret will be referenced for both backup (ReplicationSource) and for
restore (ReplicationDestination).

.. note::
   If necessary, the repository will be automatically initialized (i.e.,
   ``restic init``) during the first backup.

Configuring backup
==================

A backup policy is defined by a ReplicationSource object that uses the restic
replication method.

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   apiVersion: volsync.backube/v1alpha1
   kind: ReplicationSource
   metadata:
     name: mydata-backup
   spec:
     # The PVC to be backed up
     sourcePVC: mydata
     trigger:
       # Take a backup every 30 minutes
       schedule: "*/30 * * * *"
   restic:
     # Prune the repository (repack to free space) every 2 weeks
     pruneIntervalDays: 14
     # Name of the Secret with the connection information
     repository: restic-config
     # Retention policy for backups
     retain:
       hourly: 6
       daily: 5
       weekly: 4
       monthly: 2
       yearly: 1
     # Clone the source volume prior to taking a backup to ensure a
     # point-in-time image.
     copyMethod: Clone

Backup options
--------------

There are a number of additional configuration options not shown in the above
example. VolSync's Restic mover options closely follow those of Restic itself.

.. include:: ../inc_src_opts.rst

cacheCapacity
   This determines the size of the Restic metadata cache volume. This volume
   contains cached metadata from the backup repository. It must be large enough
   to hold the non-pruned repository metadata. The default is ``1 Gi``.
cacheStorageClassName
   This is the name of the StorageClass that should be used when provisioning
   the cache volume. It defaults to ``.spec.storageClassName``, then to the name
   of the StorageClass used by the source PVC.
cacheAccessModes
   This is the access mode(s) that should be used to provision the cache volume.
   It defaults to ``.spec.accessModes``, then to the access modes used by the
   source PVC.
pruneIntervalDays
   This determines the number of days between running ``restic prune`` on the
   repository. The prune operation repacks the data to free space, but it can
   also generate significant I/O traffic as a part of the process. Setting this
   option allows a trade-off between storage consumption (from no longer
   referenced data) and access costs.
repository
   This is the name of the Secret (in the same Namespace) that holds the
   connection information for the backup repository. The repository path should
   be unique for each PV.
retain
   This has sub-fields for ``hourly``, ``daily``, ``weekly``, ``monthly``, and
   ``yearly`` that allow setting the number of each type of backup to retain.
   There is an additional field, ``within`` that can be used to specify a time
   period during which all backups should be retained. See Restic's
   `documentation on --keep-within
   <https://restic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/060_forget.html#removing-snapshots-according-to-a-policy>`_
   for more information.

   When more than the specified number of backups are present in the repository,
   they will be removed via Restic's ``forget`` operation, and the space will be
   reclaimed during the next prune.


Performing a restore
====================

Data from a backup can be restored using the ReplicationDestination CR. In most
cases, it is desirable to perform a single restore into an empty
PersistentVolume.

For example, create a PVC to hold the restored data:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
   apiVersion: v1
   metadata:
     name: datavol
   spec:
   accessModes:
     - ReadWriteOnce
   resources:
     requests:
       storage: 3Gi

Restore the data into ``datavol``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   apiVersion: volsync.backube/v1alpha1
   kind: ReplicationDestination
   metadata:
     name: datavol-dest
   spec:
     trigger:
       manual: restore-once
     restic:
       repository: restic-repo
       destinationPVC: datavol
       copyMethod: None

In the above example, the data will be written directly into the new PVC since
it is specified via ``destinationPVC``, and no snapshot will be created since a
``copyMethod`` of ``None`` is used.

The restore operation only needs to be performed once, so instead of using a cronspec-based schedule, a manual trigger is used. After the restore completes, the ReplicationDestination object can be deleted.

.. note::
   Currently, VolSync only supports restoring the latest backup. However, older
   backups may be present in the repository (according to the retain
   parameters). Those can be accessed directly using the Restic utility plus the
   connection information and credentials from the repository Secret.

Restore options
---------------

There are a number of additional configuration options not shown in the above
example.

cacheCapacity
   This determines the size of the Restic metadata cache volume. This volume
   contains cached metadata from the backup repository. It must be large enough

   This is the name of the StorageClass that should be used when provisioning
   the cache volume. It defaults to ``.spec.storageClassName``, then to the name

   This is the access mode(s) that should be used to provision the cache volume.
   It defaults to ``.spec.accessModes``, then to the access modes used by the
