*Asynchronous volume replication for Kubernetes CSI storage*

VolSync is a Kubernetes operator that performs asynchronous replication of
persistent volumes within, or across, clusters. The replication provided by
VolSync is independent of the storage system. This allows replication to and from
storage types that don't normally support remote replication. Additionally, it
can replicate across different types (and vendors) of storage.

The project is still in the early stages, but feel free to give it a try.

To get started, see the :doc:`installation instructions <installation/index>`.
